## 🧩 About Me

I design backend systems with a strong focus on structure, data consistency, and long-term scalability.  
Rather than simply implementing features, I prioritize clear architecture, maintainable code, and stable system operations.

I continuously study new technologies and architectural approaches to broaden my technical perspective and strengthen my problem-solving skills.
